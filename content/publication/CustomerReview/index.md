  Millions of customer reviews for products are available online across hundreds of different websites. These reviews have a tremendous influence on the purchase decision of new customers and in creating a positive brand image. Understanding which of the product issues are critical in determining the product ratings is crucial for marketing teams. We have developed a solution which can derive deep insights from customer reviews which goes significantly beyond keyword based analysis. Our solution can identify key customer issues voiced in the reviews and the impact of each of these on the final rating that a customer gives the product. This insight is very actionable as it helps identify which customer concerns are responsible for bad ratings of products.
