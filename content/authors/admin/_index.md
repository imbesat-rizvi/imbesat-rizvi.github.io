I am a Technical (Research) Associate at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (RBCCPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). My research interests include Scientific Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Grounded Language Learning, Robotics and Human-Robot Interaction. 

I am currently working on enabling richer and natural interaction with social robots and am part of the team [*"Aham"*](https://aham-avatar.org/demo/) which is among the [thirty eight teams selected for the semi-finals](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/avatar/articles/38-semifinalist-teams-from-16-countries-aim-to-create-an-avatar-system) of the [ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/avatar). My contributions to the project include two-way remote speech communication with phoneme segmentation based lip synchronization and Wav2Vec2 based speech to text conversion followed by NLP based action identification and execution on social tele-robot *"Asha"*. Part of the work is open sourced as [*sonorus*](https://pypi.org/project/sonorus/) pypi package and [*imperio*](https://github.com/pensieves/imperio) github repository. As a future step, in addition to tele-operation, I am also working towards enabling language (NLP) based instruction execution through reinforcement learning (RL).

I have also worked on defining causal annotation schema in clinical notes, classifying them using BERT based language models and customer review analysis using natural language processing. I received a Master's degree from the Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore where I worked on information-theoretic graph characterization and generation of potential drug molecular structures as well as chemical properties prediction of hydrocarbons under the supervision of Prof. Debnath Pal and Dr. Chandan Raychaudhury. My B.Tech. thesis work under the supervision of Prof. Subrata Kumar Ghosh at IIT (ISM), Dhanbad was developing an improved mathematical model of thermal conductivity for nanofluids.
