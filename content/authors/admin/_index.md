I am a Technical (Research) Associate at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems (RBCCPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://www.iisc.ac.in/). My research interests include Scientific Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and Multi-modal Machine Learning. 

I am currently working on a project to enable richer and natural interactions with social robots. My contributions to the project include two-way remote speech communication with phoneme segmentation based lip synchronization and Wav2Vec2 architecture based speech to text conversion followed by NLP based semantic action identification and execution on social tele-robot *"Asha"*. Part of the work is open sourced as [*sonorus*](https://pypi.org/project/sonorus/) pypi package and [*imperio*](https://github.com/pensieves/imperio) github repository. As a future step, in addition to tele-operation, I am also working towards enabling language (NLP) based instruction execution through reinforcement learning (RL). 

Our team [*"Aham"*](https://aham-avatar.org/demo/) (Asha) is [one of the finalists in the International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), 2021 (Competition track)](https://www.colips.org/conferences/icsr2021/wp/awards/) and is also among the [thirty eight semi-finalists](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/avatar/articles/38-semifinalist-teams-from-16-countries-aim-to-create-an-avatar-system) in the [ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/avatar).

I am also working on identifying causal interactions and classification in unstructured text data. The research pertains to defining causal annotation schema in clinical notes with a focus on causality types and directionality of interaction as communicated in the text between the cause and effect bio-medical concepts/entities. We created an annotated *"MIMICause"* corpus based on the MIMIC-III clinical notes and the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) shared task dataset; and trained baselines using BERT and Clinical-BERT based language models. We have also created a dataset comprising of causal and non-causal sentences (without causality types and direction) from diabetes-related tweets and have trained models for identification of causal sentences as well as the biomedical entities.

In the past at Hewlett-Packard (HP) Inc., under the guidance of [Dr. Niranjan Damera-Venkata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=daDIHuUAAAAJ&hl=en), I have worked on customer review analysis using self-attention based LSTM network and predicting printer part failures with an LSTM based architecture using multi-instance learning based hybrid loss. I received a Master's degree from the Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore where I worked on information-theoretic graph characterization and generation of non-isomorphic potential drug molecular graph structures as well as shanon entropy based chemical properties prediction of hydrocarbons under the supervision of [Prof. Debnath Pal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vDgGOVUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. Chandan Raychaudhury. My B.Tech. thesis work under the supervision of [Prof. Subrata Kumar Ghosh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MA5Cr0YAAAAJ&hl=en) at IIT (ISM), Dhanbad was developing an improved mathematical model of thermal conductivity for nanofluids based on a linear conductivity gradient across the interfacial nano-layer between the nano-particles and the base fluid, and solving the resulting steady state heat conduction differential equation.
