The model is trained using the huggingface dataset \u0026ldquo;papluca/language-identification\u0026rdquo;. The dataset was created by collecting data from 3 sources: Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus, XNLI, and STSb Multi MT. The dataset contains text in the following 20 languages:\narabic (ar), bulgarian (bg), german (de), modern greek (el), english (en), spanish (es), french (fr), hindi (hi), italian (it), japanese (ja), dutch (nl), polish (pl), portuguese (pt), russian (ru), swahili (sw), thai (th), turkish (tr), urdu (ur), vietnamese (vi), and chinese (zh)\nModel description and training: The language text is converted into a feature vector using a TFIDF vectorizer which can be fit on either word, character (\u0026lsquo;char\u0026rsquo;) or character within word boundaries (\u0026lsquo;char_wb\u0026rsquo;) level. The vectorizer can also be fit on various n-gram ranges. The best performance was achieved with \u0026lsquo;char_wb\u0026rsquo; and an n-gram range of (3,4).\nA Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) model is trained for multi-class (20-language) classification with a smoothening factor (alpha) of 1. Other models were tried too but they were comparatively slow and didn\u0026rsquo;t lead to any significant increase in the accuracy.\nEven with such a simple setting, the performance achieved was 99.22% accuracy on the test set of the papluca/language-identification dataset. The achieved accuracy is competitive to the reported accuracy of 99.60% on the test set using their papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection model which is a finetuned version of the xlm-roberta-base model.\nPrediction and accounting for unseen languages during training: The trained model will only return prediction and probabilities for the 20 languages seen during training. Thus, using the model as is will incorrectly classify to one of those seen language categories even when the new text belongs to an unseen language. To address this, we use probability thresholding on the class with highest probability and report that class only when its probability is more than the threshold, otherwise report the class to be \u0026lsquo;Other\u0026rsquo; i.e. such a language was not seen during training.\nThis probability threshold can be played around with for a desired precision or recall value, as increasing this threshold will increase precision but some seen language examples can be classified as \u0026lsquo;Other\u0026rsquo;, while decreasing this threshold is going to increase the recall but more and more \u0026lsquo;unseen\u0026rsquo; languages will get incorrectly classified to one of the 20 seen languages. A probability threshold of 0.3 seemed to work well for the given dataset. In the demo shown at the top, the last example was a gibberish input which was correctly classified as \u0026lsquo;Other\u0026rsquo; i.e. none of the seen languages.\n","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654128000,"objectID":"a947754826f001702206dcb57c3a8738","permalink":"https://imbesat-rizvi.github.io/project/languageidentification/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/languageidentification/","section":"project","summary":"A machine learning model for identifying 20 diverse languages as well as reporting 'Other' for languages on which model was not trained.

Deep learning and natural language processing methods were applied to focus on tweets with personal and emotional content. A cause-effect-tweet dataset was manually labeled and used to train 1) a fine-tuned Bertweet model to detect causal sentences containing a causal association 2) a CRF model with BERT based features to extract possible cause-effect associations. Causes and effects were clustered in a semi-supervised approach and visualised in an interactive cause-effect-network. \n\n**Results** -- Causal sentences were detected with a recall of 68% in an imbalanced dataset. A CRF model with BERT based features outperformed a fine-tuned BERT model for cause-effect detection with a macro recall of 68%. This led to 96,676 sentences with cause-effect associations. \"Diabetes\" was identified as the central cluster followed by \"Death\" and \"Insulin\". Insulin pricing related causes were frequently associated with \"Death\". \n\n**Conclusions** -- A novel methodology was developed to detect causal sentences and identify both explicit and implicit, single and multi-word cause and corresponding effect as expressed in diabetes-related tweets leveraging BERT-based architectures and visualised as cause-effect-network. Extracting causal associations on real-life, patient reported outcomes in social media data provides a useful complementary source of information in diabetes research.\n","tags":["Natural Language Processing","NLP","BioNLP","BERT","Language Models","Medical Informatics"],"title":"Identifying causal relations in tweets using deep learning: Use case on diabetes-related tweets from 2017-2021","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[2022-02-24] Our paper (as a first co-author) titled \u0026ldquo;MIMICause: Representation and automatic extraction of causal relation types from clinical notes\u0026rdquo; got accepted in the Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2022\n[2021-11-17] Our entry \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;ASHA: A Tele-operated robot nurse\u0026rdquo; secured a runner-up position in the \u0026ldquo;Innovation in Responses to COVID-19\u0026rdquo; category of the International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR) 2021 Robot Design Competition\n[2021-10-21] Our entry titled \u0026ldquo;ASHA: A Tele-operated robot nurse\u0026rdquo; submitted to the International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR) 2021 Robot Design Competition is shortlisted as the finalists to be presented during the conference.\n[2021-10-14] Pre-print of our paper titled \u0026ldquo;MIMICause : Defining, identifying and predicting types of causal relationships between biomedical concepts from clinical notes\u0026rdquo; is live on arXiv.\n[2021-06-16] Published sonorus as an open-sourced python pypi package - a collection of audio and speech processing components for social robots and tele-robots.\n[2021-04-05] Our team Aham is announced to be one of the 38 semifinalists in the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition.\n","date":1633392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633392000,"objectID":"a0812ae5f3c926fea6faf4472cefc8e2","permalink":"https://imbesat-rizvi.github.io/news/","publishdate":"2021-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/","section":"","summary":"List of news.\r\n","tags":[],"title":"News","type":"page"},{"authors":["Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Among them, total information on atomic number (TIZ), graph vertex complexity (HV) and total information on bonds (TIBAT), considered together showed the best correlation along with a low standard deviation (r2 = 0.97, s = 21.14) with gas phase entropy values of 130 compounds. The multiple regression equation treating these three indices as independent variables was statistically highly signiﬁcant which was evident from the F-statistics. In particular, very small difference between r2 and r2-pred values indicates that the regression model is not overﬁtted and is, therefore, suitable for prediction purposes. When truly used as a training set to predict (from regression equation) 40 additional compounds we get a very high correlation (r2 = 0.975), which remains almost identical (r2 = 0.97) for the combined data set of 170 compounds. The three indices appear to be useful descriptors producing correlation that remains stable with the change in the size of the data set. Also, the information-theoretical measures appear to capture an additive-cum-constitutive nature of gas phase entropy yielding an acceptable statistical ﬁt.

The rule-based method is also used for identifying suitable activity-related vertices (atoms) present in the active compounds of a data set, and identified vertex is used for combinatorial generation of structures. An algorithm has also been described for identifying suitable training set–test set splits (combinations) for a given data set since getting a suitable training set is of utmost importance for getting acceptable activity prediction. The method has also been used, to our knowledge for the first time, for matching and searching rooted trees and sub-trees in the compounds of a data set to discover novel drug candidates. The performance of different modules of the proposed method has been investigated by considering two different series of bioactive compounds: (1) convulsant and anticonvulsant barbiturates and (2) nucleoside analogues with their activities against HIV and a data set of 3779 potential antitubercular compounds. While activity prediction, compound prioritization and structure generation studies have been carried out for barbiturates and nucleoside analogues, activity-related tree–sub-tree searching in the said data set has been carried for screening potential antitubercular compounds. All the results show a high level of success rate. The possible relation of this work with scaffold hopping and inverse quantitative structure–activity relationship (iQSAR) problem has also been discussed. This newly developed method seems to hold promise for discovering novel therapeutic candidates.\n","tags":[],"title":"Combinatorial Drug Discovery from Activity-Related Substructure Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A vectorized iterative implementation of the paper \u0026ldquo;Retrofitting Word Vectors to Semantic Lexicons\u0026rdquo; in which the vector space representations are further refined using relational information from the semantic lexicons.

Although some combinatorial structure generation algorithms are available, any method for generating structures from activity-linked substructural topological information is not yet reported.\n\n**Objective**: To develop a method using graph-theoretical techniques for generating structures of antitubercular compounds combinatorially from activity-linked substructural topological information, predict activity and prioritize and screen potential drug candidates.\n\n**Methods**: Activity related vertices are identified from datasets composed of both active and inactive or, differently active compounds and structures are generated combinatorially using the topological distance distribution associated with those vertices. Biological activities are predicted using topological distance based vertex indices and a rule based method. Generated structures are prioritized using a newly defined Molecular Priority Score (MPS).\n\n**Results**: Studies considering a series of Acid Alkyl Ester (AAE) compounds and three known anti-tubercular drugs show that active compounds can be generated from substructural information of other active compounds for all these classes of compounds. Activity predictions show high level of success rate and a number of highly active AAE compounds produced high MPS score indicating that MPS score may help prioritize and screen potential drug molecules. A possible relation of this work with scaffold hopping and inverse Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (iQSAR) problem has also been discussed.\n\n**Conclusion**: The proposed method seems to hold promise for discovering novel therapeutic candidates for combating Tuberculosis and may be useful for discovering novel drug molecules for the treatment of other diseases as well.\n","tags":[],"title":"Combinatorial Design of Molecule using Activity-Linked Substructural Topological Information as Applied to Antitubercular Compounds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful but computationally expensive machine learning (ML) algorithm for supervised classification task which is frequently witnessed in the ML domain.

For studying the heat transfer behaviour of the nanofluids, precise values of their thermal conductivity are required. For predicting the correct value of thermal conductivity of a nanofluid, mathematical models are necessary. In this paper, the effective thermal conductivity of various nanofluids has been reported by using both experimental and mathematical modelling. The paper aims to discuss these issues. **Design/methodology/approach** -- Hamilton and Crosser equation was used for predicting the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, and the obtained values were compared with the experimental findings. Nanofluid studied in this paper are Al2O3 in base fluid water, Al2O3 in base fluid ethylene glycol, CuO in base fluid water, CuO in base fluid ethylene glycol, TiO2 in base fluid ethylene glycol. In addition, studies have been made on nanofluids with CuO and Al2O3 in base fluid SAE 30 particularly for heavy machinery applications. **Findings** -- The study shows that increase in thermal conductivity of the nanofluid with particle concentration is in good agreement with that predicted by Hamilton and Crosser at typical lower concentrations. **Research limitations/implications** -- It has been observed that deviation between experimental and theoretical results increases as the volume concentration of nanoparticles increases. Therefore, the mathematical model cannot be used for predicting thermal conductivity at high concentration values. **Originality/value** -- Studies on nanoparticles with a standard mineral oil as base fluid have not been considered extensively as per the previous literatures available.
