The research pertains to defining causal annotation schema in clinical notes with a focus on causality types and directionality of interaction as communicated in the text between the cause and effect bio-medical concepts/entities. We created an annotated corpus and trained baselines using BERT and Clinical-BERT based language models. We have also created a dataset comprising of causal and non-causal sentences (without causality types and direction) from diabetes-related tweets and have trained models for identification of causal sentences as well as the biomedical entities.\nIn the past at Hewlett-Packard (HP) Inc., under the guidance of Dr. Niranjan Damera-Venkata, I have worked on customer review analysis using self-attention based LSTM network and predicting printer part failures with an LSTM based architecture using multi-instance learning based hybrid loss.

Leveraging machine learning methods, we aim to extract both explicit and implicit multi-word *cause-effect* associations in diabetes-related tweets, where opinion, feelings and observations are expressed in real-time.\n\n**Materials and Methods** -- More than 30 million diabetes-related tweets in English were collected between April 2017 and January 2021. Deep learning and natural language processing methods were applied to focus on relevant tweets with personal and emotional content. A *cause-effect-tweet* dataset was manually labeled and used to train 1) a fine-tuned Bertweet model to detect *causal sentences* containing a causal association 2) a CRF model with BERT based features to extract possible cause-effect associations. Active learning was applied to augment the training data efficiently.\n\n**Results** -- We were able to detect *causal sentences* with an accuracy of 71% in an imbalanced dataset. A CRF model with BERT based features outperformed a fine-tuned BERT model for *cause-effect* detection with a macro F1 of 68%. This led to 96,676 tweets with cause-effect associations. “Diabetes” was identified as the central cluster followed by “Death” and “Insulin”. Insulin pricing related causes were frequently associated with “Death”.\n\n**Conclusions** -- A novel methodology was developed to tackle the challenging task of detecting causal sentences and identifying both explicit and implicit, single and multi-word cause as well as corresponding effect as expressed in diabetes-related tweets leveraging BERT-based architectures in combination with a manually labeled dataset augmented via active learning. Extracting causal associations on real-life, patient reported outcomes in social media data provides a useful complementary source of information in diabetes research.  \n","tags":[],"title":"Identifying causal associations in tweets using deep learning: Use case on diabetes-related tweets from 2017-2021","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[2021-10-21] Our entry titled \u0026ldquo;ASHA: A Tele-operated robot nurse\u0026rdquo; submitted to the International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR) 2021 Robot Design Competition is shortlisted as the finalists to be presented during the conference.\n[2021-10-14] Pre-print of our paper titled \u0026ldquo;MIMICause : Defining, identifying and predicting types of causal relationships between biomedical concepts from clinical notes\u0026rdquo; is live on arXiv.\n[2021-06-16] Published sonorus as an open-sourced python pypi package - a collection of audio and speech processing components for social robots and tele-robots.\n[2021-04-05] Our team Aham is announced to be one of the 38 semifinalists in the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition.\n","date":1633392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633392000,"objectID":"a0812ae5f3c926fea6faf4472cefc8e2","permalink":"https://imbesat-rizvi.github.io/news/","publishdate":"2021-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/","section":"","summary":"List of news.\r\n","tags":[],"title":"News","type":"page"},{"authors":["Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Among them, total information on atomic number (TIZ), graph vertex complexity (HV) and total information on bonds (TIBAT), considered together showed the best correlation along with a low standard deviation (r2 = 0.97, s = 21.14) with gas phase entropy values of 130 compounds. The multiple regression equation treating these three indices as independent variables was statistically highly signiﬁcant which was evident from the F-statistics. In particular, very small difference between r2 and r2-pred values indicates that the regression model is not overﬁtted and is, therefore, suitable for prediction purposes. When truly used as a training set to predict (from regression equation) 40 additional compounds we get a very high correlation (r2 = 0.975), which remains almost identical (r2 = 0.97) for the combined data set of 170 compounds. The three indices appear to be useful descriptors producing correlation that remains stable with the change in the size of the data set. Also, the information-theoretical measures appear to capture an additive-cum-constitutive nature of gas phase entropy yielding an acceptable statistical ﬁt.

The rule-based method is also used for identifying suitable activity-related vertices (atoms) present in the active compounds of a data set, and identified vertex is used for combinatorial generation of structures. An algorithm has also been described for identifying suitable training set–test set splits (combinations) for a given data set since getting a suitable training set is of utmost importance for getting acceptable activity prediction. The method has also been used, to our knowledge for the first time, for matching and searching rooted trees and sub-trees in the compounds of a data set to discover novel drug candidates. The performance of different modules of the proposed method has been investigated by considering two different series of bioactive compounds: (1) convulsant and anticonvulsant barbiturates and (2) nucleoside analogues with their activities against HIV and a data set of 3779 potential antitubercular compounds. While activity prediction, compound prioritization and structure generation studies have been carried out for barbiturates and nucleoside analogues, activity-related tree–sub-tree searching in the said data set has been carried for screening potential antitubercular compounds. All the results show a high level of success rate. The possible relation of this work with scaffold hopping and inverse quantitative structure–activity relationship (iQSAR) problem has also been discussed. This newly developed method seems to hold promise for discovering novel therapeutic candidates.\n","tags":[],"title":"Combinatorial Drug Discovery from Activity-Related Substructure Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Himanshu Tiwari","Shameed Sait","Md Imbesat Hassan Rizvi","Niranjan Damera-Venkata"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

For studying the heat transfer behaviour of the nanofluids, precise values of their thermal conductivity are required. For predicting the correct value of thermal conductivity of a nanofluid, mathematical models are necessary. In this paper, the effective thermal conductivity of various nanofluids has been reported by using both experimental and mathematical modelling. The paper aims to discuss these issues. **Design/methodology/approach** -- Hamilton and Crosser equation was used for predicting the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, and the obtained values were compared with the experimental findings. Nanofluid studied in this paper are Al2O3 in base fluid water, Al2O3 in base fluid ethylene glycol, CuO in base fluid water, CuO in base fluid ethylene glycol, TiO2 in base fluid ethylene glycol. In addition, studies have been made on nanofluids with CuO and Al2O3 in base fluid SAE 30 particularly for heavy machinery applications. **Findings** -- The study shows that increase in thermal conductivity of the nanofluid with particle concentration is in good agreement with that predicted by Hamilton and Crosser at typical lower concentrations. **Research limitations/implications** -- It has been observed that deviation between experimental and theoretical results increases as the volume concentration of nanoparticles increases. Therefore, the mathematical model cannot be used for predicting thermal conductivity at high concentration values. **Originality/value** -- Studies on nanoparticles with a standard mineral oil as base fluid have not been considered extensively as per the previous literatures available.

However, Maxwell’s model does not consider the effect of interfacial layer, Brownian motion of nano-particle and nanoparticle aggregation. In this paper, the effect of interfacial layer on thermal conductivity is considered. A simple expression has been derived to determine thermal conductivity of nanofluid considering interfacial layer formed on the nano particles. The thermal conductivity of the interfacial layer has been precisely determined and results are found to be closer to the experimental values, hence, further improving the results of classical Maxwell model.\n","tags":[],"title":"Mathematical modelling of thermal conductivity for nanofluid considering interfacial nano-layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://imbesat-rizvi.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
